# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R using the ggplot2 package from the tidyverse.  

We will install these packages:

- tidyverse
- readxl: to read in excel files (in many ways)
- here: to help with file paths

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # install.pacakges("tidyverse")
library(readxl) #install.packages("readxl")
library(here) #install.packages("here")
```

# California National Parks Data
```{r read-data}

#read in and name it
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data/ca_np.csv"))
#also be written
#ca_np <- read_csv("data". "ca_np.csv")
#ca_np <- read_csv("data/ca_np.csv")
```
